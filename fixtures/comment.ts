I was a callous monster long before I had the consciousness to realise it. Maybe, things are different in Germany and America but I doubt it. This video is a brilliant piece of work and I thank you for it.`,

  body: `Before clicking on this video, I only knew that some German guy named Goethe (had no idea how to pronounce it) had written a big book called ‚ÄúFaust,‚Äù about a guy who made a deal with the devil, and that it was a big influence on Nietzsche and others.

But it was a very clear, interesting, thoughtful, engaging, and highly enjoyable listen.  Thank you.

It felt like I had asked a knowledgeable friend ‚Äúhey, can you tell me all about that one book ‚ÄòFaust‚Äô that people talk about a lot, written by that ‚ÄòGoth‚Äô guy?‚Äù`,

I am woefully undereducated in classical literature. I blame my Catholic upbringing and Catholic school for cornering me into atheism by high school. And an English literature teacher who managed an impossible task; turning thought-provoking texts into bland gibberish through rote learning and repetition.
Not that my school would have touched Faust & Mephisto; the idea of students reciting non-biblical texts which dissect deals with an adversary would be considered akin to a seance in the school chapel.

Anyway an hour in and wanting to cancel my other commitments. This is so beautifully analysed. I'll be back!`,

  body: `This channel, albeit in the public domain, due to its content, is for the few, and so, it is with the major works of art, literature and philosophy, they are not meant to be understood by the average reader.  

By necessary, such knowledge would be esoteric, hermetic, because, the rarest treasures are often left untouched by a less capable generation of readership. 

A good indicative for a great channel is the boundless multifariousness and multiplicity of its content, because, with constant posting, the literary and narrative devices (e.g., simile, tropes and figurative speech) would soon become trite, commonplace and hackneyed. 

Whereas a charismatic, eloquent,  charming, good looking face could draw the viewers by the score, a man or woman of true genius is often found as the most beautiful, nay, original, but in the faceless scribe of remarkable literature and brilliance, and such qualities could still win a more distinguished company among the kindred souls.`,
